# Saddle
Saddle is a modular server software built on top of [dragonfly](https://github.com/df-mc/dragonfly). It aims to make it 
easy both for developers to make plugins and for users to install and use them. For a comparison to dragonfly, please 
read [here](#saddle-compared-to-dragonfly). If you are looking to run a saddle server with plugins, you might want to 
take a look at [the launcher](https://github.com/saddlemc/launcher).

***NOTE:*** *Saddle is currently in it's very early stages. It is currently just a concept, and everything from its
internals to the name are subject to change. A lot of APIs are not yet implemented. Saddle is by no means ready to be 
used for a production server.*

### Saddle compared to Dragonfly
While saddle is built on top of dragonfly, using it as a library, it is pretty different from and not affiliated with 
dragonfly. They are both trying to achieve a different goal. While dragonfly is more meant towards developers and more 
technical users, saddle is meant to be used by everyone looking to create their own server but may not know how to code.

However, even if you do know how to code you might still have a reason to use Saddle, as it provides an interface for
different logic to work together. In dragonfly there are no such standards built in.
